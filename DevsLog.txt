Month 1 Progress [2/24/25 -> 3/24/25]

####--- LOG 1 ---####

Log Date: 3/18/25

I've worked on getting a first level and basic game mechanics implemented. 
The character sprite is a stand in for now. The character can move in a 
16x16 grid, the character can teleport, the character is in the works of 
being able to talk to NPCs. There is a unfinished beginning sequence, 
title screen and about half a dozen rooms currently.

The current goal is to polish the dialogue, finish the opening animation, 
begin incorporating menu screens (Including character inventory, monster 
inventory, battle menus and related.), incorporate needed NPCs for first 
location and begin working on new locations using the foundations made in 
this period.

Month 2 Progress [3/24/25 -> 4/24/25]

Log Date: 3/24/25

Since last log, i've finished the opening sequence animation to the title
screen, and incorporated the dialogue to an acceptable extent. It doesnt 
have the indicator to continue, or conclude at the end of the text being 
displayed, and repeats. But for now, it serves the purpose of showing 
dialogue for events so we can build npc encounters. There are 2 NPCs to
interact with in different rooms so far for testing. 

I have incorporated route transitions as well. the music for the route 
transition room reflects the area you came from currently, and when 
looping, the music doesnt transition correctly to immediatly playing again,
but its workable for now.

I've begun working on picking up items, an inventory, and a save/ load system.
Since, as of now, the way they work is going to be related unless a new 
method should be adopted. It's nearly to a workable state, and when it is, i'll
start on incorporating GUI for everything.




####--- LOG 3 --- MONTH 2 ---####

Log Date: 3/30/25

In the process of incorporating the inventory, and save/ load system, I ran into
some critical problems with the structure of the project. I needed a more dynamic
system, and as a current solution, I have made a large amount of the functions 
modular in thier own Scripts. After days of testing and debugging, I once again 
have the character moving properly in this new system and colliding correctly. 
There are some issues still though. 

The warps no longer work atm, and the character seems to have issuses animating
correctly, as they are currently 'ghosting' and appearing for a moment in the next
block before they move there, then dissapearing as the character moves into the spot.

I'm backing up and logging at this point, for I have the game in the best place its
been since incorporating the new system. I will continue to work toward returning to 
previous functionality.




####--- LOG 4 --- MONTH 2 ---####

Log Date: 4/6/25

I have been working towards restoring previous functionality since incorporating this 
new system. I have (mostly) restored walking functionality, with the side-effect of 
what I can only describe as a pre-movement "ghost" of some sort, of the player character 
appearing ahead of the, let's call it the "Main" image of the player, breifly before 
the player animates and assumes the position. This does not seem to impact movement, 
collisions, but interactions w/ objects, like picking an item up, or teleporting, lock 
the character in place for some reason. Items do dissapear when picked up and are added 
to the inventory it seems. 

I will tackle the ghost problem at a later point and focus on 
further refining the inventory and fixing the player being stuck on interacting. This 
update is primarily meant to address the, workable-for-now movement system. It will 
suffice for testng purposes until a time where a full inventory and save system are 
implemented to a acceptable level, unless some sort of lightbulb moment occours. 

Other soonish considerations are implementing the battle system and further refining the 
NPC dialogue.
