Month 1 Progress [2/24/25 -> 3/24/25]

####--- LOG 1 ---####

Log Date: 3/18/25

I've worked on getting a first level and basic game mechanics implemented. 
The character sprite is a stand in for now. The character can move in a 
16x16 grid, the character can teleport, the character is in the works of 
being able to talk to NPCs. There is a unfinished beginning sequence, 
title screen and about half a dozen rooms currently.

The current goal is to polish the dialogue, finish the opening animation, 
begin incorporating menu screens (Including character inventory, monster 
inventory, battle menus and related.), incorporate needed NPCs for first 
location and begin working on new locations using the foundations made in 
this period.

Since last log, i've finished the opening sequence animation to the title
screen, and incorporated the dialogue to an acceptable extent. It doesnt 
have the indicator to continue, or conclude at the end of the text being 
displayed, and repeats. But for now, it serves the purpose of showing 
dialogue for events so we can build npc encounters. There are 2 NPCs to
interact with in different rooms so far for testing. 

I have incorporated route transitions as well. the music for the route 
transition room reflects the area you came from currently, and when 
looping, the music doesnt transition correctly to immediatly playing again,
but its workable for now.

I've begun working on picking up items, an inventory, and a save/ load system.
Since, as of now, the way they work is going to be related unless a new 
method should be adopted. It's nearly to a workable state, and when it is, i'll
start on incorporating GUI for everything.
