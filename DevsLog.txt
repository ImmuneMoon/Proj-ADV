Month 1 Progress [2/24/25 -> 3/24/25]

####---LOG 1---####

Log Date: 3/18/25

I've worked on getting a first level and basic game mechanics implemented. 
The character sprite is a stand in for now. The character can move in a 
16x16 grid, the character can teleport, the character is in the works of 
being able to talk to NPCs. There is a unfinished beginning sequence, 
title screen and about half a dozen rooms currently.

The current goal is to polish the dialogue, finish the opening animation, 
begin incorporating menu screens (Including character inventory, monster 
inventory, battle menus and related.), incorporate needed NPCs for first 
location and begin working on new locations using the foundations made in 
this period.
